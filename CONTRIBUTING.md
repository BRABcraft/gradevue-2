# Contributing to GradeVue 2!

GradeVue 2 is looking for more maintainers! Especially, frontend developers (We might outsource this to Sam Altman, which I would rather no do. Taints the genuine nature of GradeVue 2).
Pull requests and issues will be reviewed as soon as possible.

All submitted PRs must be in HTML/CSS/JS. I will not review any TS nonsense.

## Do you want to host GradeVue 2?

It would be ideal to not use Cloud hosting providers. If you want to host it on your own server, then please contact me. I will be very happy.

## Why no TypeScript?

All that TypeScript is doing is transpiling into JavaScript. The issue is that this JavaScript file is larger than if we had just wrote JS beforehand! I want to minimize file sizes because I really do not want to pay for increased bandwidth. If you really want TypeScript, see "Do you want to host GradeVue 2?"
