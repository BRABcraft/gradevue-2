# Contributing to GradeVue 2!

GradeVue 2 is looking for more maintainers! Especially, frontend developers (We might outsource this to Sam Altman, which I would rather no do. Taints the genuine nature of GradeVue 2).
Pull requests and issues will be reviewed as soon as possible.

All submitted PRs must be in HTML/CSS/JS. I will not review any TS nonsense (see "Why no TypeScript?" for exceptions).

## Do you want to host GradeVue 2?

It would be ideal to not use Cloud hosting providers. If you want to host it on your own server, then please contact me. I will be very happy.

## Why no TypeScript?

All that TypeScript is doing is transpiling into JavaScript. The issue is that this JavaScript file is larger than if we had just wrote JS beforehand! I want to minimize file sizes because I really do not want to pay for increased bandwidth. If you really want TypeScript, then see "Do you want to host GradeVue 2?"

## PRs Must not compromise our privacy policy.
- Never record user data on the backend. (All data must be stored in the browser cache.)

## Does ______ really matter?

### Browser compatibility?
It must work with Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome before being merged. Nothing else really matters; however, issues that use other (inferior) browsers (id est Edge, IE et cetera) will still be addressed. God bless you if you're in the IE camp.

### School district compatibility?
Priority will be given to Virginia Beach City Public Schools as long as no one from another district is hosting the webstie (see Do you want to host GradeVue 2?). However, I want everyone to be able to use it easily (unlike [BetterVue](https://github.com/dvsj/bettervue)).
